## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

::: cell
``` {.r .cell-code}
1 + 1
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
    [1] 2
:::
:::

You can add options to executable code like this

::: cell
::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
    [1] 4
:::
:::

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
